package.json, gruntfile.js, bower.json
step 1: run npm install grunt, bower, and grunt plugins
step 2: type grunt, it reads Gruntfile.js, parses it, evaluates what needs to happen
step 3: grunt-bower, so, I'm going to execute bower, and bower reads bower.json and installs mocha
alternative: connect...
INSTALL mocha.js, mocha.css
